When you click on the button, it takes the class away from the welcome div.
#start, #welcome, your event listener needs to be outside the function
Indent the format.
You want to unhide it only, but now you take away all the classes.

Trying to convert fahrenheit to celsius.
parse.int > (parseFloat(f)- 32) * 5/9;
float passes in decimals
output.texContent = fToc(input.value);
undefined variable f
return(parseFloat(f)-32 *5/9;

convert is an event handler
function convert(event)
some browsers don't handle event without it being in the function (ie firefox)
